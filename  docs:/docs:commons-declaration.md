# Gofu Commons Declaration  
**CC0 1.0 Universal — Public Domain**

Gofu is an open-source, bean-based food created from traditional methods of soaking, grinding, heating, curdling, and pressing legumes.

Its purpose is to expand food sovereignty, reduce reliance on monocultures, and support communities with a low-cost, locally adaptable protein.

   Gofu belongs to everyone.

4. **Use in Community Spaces**

   Gofu may be used in shelters, school cafeterias, mutual aid kitchens, home cooking, regenerative agriculture programs, and any context where nourishment and sovereignty are needed.

5. **Teaching as Commons**

   Teaching Gofu is itself part of the commons.

   Lessons, modules, workshops, Discovery Mode activities, and Monster Kitchen stories may all be freely created and shared.

6. **Spirit of the Offering**

   No one is obligated to attribute this declaration, but all are invited to carry its spirit:

   > food as a right, not a commodity;  
   > nourishment as relationship, not extraction.

---

Gofu is offered openly, joyfully, and irreversibly to the world.  

May it travel far.  
May it feed many.  
May its simplicity strengthen the hands that need it most.

— Released into the Commons, freely and forever.
