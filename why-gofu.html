<h2>Why Gofu?</h2>

<p>
Gofu is not just a recipe. It is a response to the world we are living in — a world 
of rising food prices, collapsing trust, processed dependency, and communities 
struggling to feed themselves with dignity. Gofu returns something ancient and 
essential: the ability to turn a bean, water, time, and heat into a complete, 
nourishing food that belongs to everyone.
</p>

<h3>1. Food Deserts and Food Apartheid</h3>
<p>
Millions of families live in places where fresh, affordable food is rare.  
Gofu breaks that pattern by turning any dry bean — one of the most accessible 
foods on Earth — into something versatile, satisfying, and healthy.  
It lowers dependency on expensive, centralized supply chains and re-centers 
local choice and creativity.
</p>

<h3>2. Gut Health and Long-Term Wellbeing</h3>
<p>
Beans are microbiome medicine.  
They stabilize blood sugar, nourish gut flora, reduce inflammation, and provide 
steady energy.  
Gofu makes beans easy to digest, easy to flavor, easy to love — especially for 
children and families who struggle with texture, time, or access.
</p>

<h3>3. A Sustainable Energy Source for Movement & RageDance</h3>
<p>
Gofu supports sustained physical practice — whether dance, martial arts, or 
everyday movement.  
It delivers slow, steady energy without spikes or crashes.  
For RageDance practitioners, it offers a way to fuel powerful movement without 
resorting to sugar, caffeine, or processed stimulants.  
It nourishes without depleting the land or the body.
</p>

<h3>4. A Child-Friendly, Community-Friendly Process</h3>
<p>
The steps of making Gofu are simple enough for a child to understand and 
beautiful enough for a community to gather around.  
Soak → blend → heat → press → taste.  
It teaches chemistry, patience, creativity, and care.  
It invites children into the kitchen as makers — not just consumers.
</p>

<h3>5. Low Cost in a Time of Rising Hunger</h3>
<p>
Beans remain one of the most affordable proteins on Earth.  
A single pound can feed a family.  
Gofu multiplies that value — becoming soups, snacks, cutlets, spreads, 
baked goods, and more.  
In a time when many are choosing between groceries and rent, Gofu offers 
something rare: dignity without expense.
</p>

<h3>6. Ecological and Climate-Friendly</h3>
<p>
Beans fix nitrogen, enrich soil, support biodiversity, and have a tiny 
water and carbon footprint compared to industrial proteins.  
Gofu aligns nourishment with stewardship.  
It is a food that regenerates the ground it comes from.
</p>

<h3>7. Common Knowledge in an Age of Gatekeeping</h3>
<p>
Many food traditions that once belonged to communities have been privatized, 
branded, or turned into commodities.  
Gofu is a reminder that some of the best tools for survival and flourishing 
have no owner — and should never have one.  
Releasing Gofu into the commons is an act of defiance and a gesture of love.

Eating together is one form of courage.  
Teaching each other how to make food from almost nothing is another.  
Gofu belongs to those who need it — and to those who will carry it forward.
