    <h2>Why Gofu?</h2>

    <p>
    Gofu is not just a recipe. It is a response to the world we are living in — a world
    of rising food prices, collapsing trust, processed dependency, and communities
    struggling to feed themselves with dignity. Gofu returns something ancient and
    essential: the ability to turn a bean, water, time, and heat into a complete,
    nourishing food that belongs to everyone.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Food Deserts and Food Apartheid</h3>
    <p>
    Millions of families live in places where fresh, affordable food is rare.
    Gofu breaks that pattern by turning any dry bean — one of the most accessible
    foods on Earth — into something versatile, satisfying, and healthy.
    It lowers dependency on expensive, centralized supply chains and re-centers
    local choice and creativity.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Gut Health and Long-Term Wellbeing</h3>
    <p>
    Beans stabilize blood sugar, nourish gut flora, reduce inflammation, and provide
    steady energy. Gofu makes beans easy to digest, easy to flavor, and easy to love —
    especially for children and families who struggle with texture or access.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Sustainable Energy for Movement & RageDance</h3>
    <p>
    Gofu provides slow, steady, nourishing energy for movement-heavy practice.
    For RageDance practitioners, it fuels powerful movement without sugar, caffeine,
    or processed stimulants — nourishing without depleting the land or the body.
    </p>

    <h3>4. A Child-Friendly, Community-Friendly Process</h3>
    <p>
    Soak → blend → heat → press → taste. A process simple enough for children and
    beautiful enough for community kitchens. It teaches chemistry, patience,
    creativity, and care. It invites children into the kitchen as makers,
    not just consumers.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Low Cost in a Time of Rising Hunger</h3>
    <p>
    Beans are one of the most affordable proteins on Earth. A single pound can feed
    a family. Gofu multiplies that value — becoming soups, snacks, cutlets, spreads,
    baked goods, and more. It offers dignity without expense.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Ecological and Climate-Friendly</h3>
    <p>
    Beans fix nitrogen, enrich soil, support biodiversity, and have a tiny
    carbon footprint. Gofu aligns nourishment with stewardship: a food that
    regenerates the ground it comes from.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Common Knowledge in an Age of Gatekeeping</h3>
    <p>
    Many food traditions once shared by communities have been privatized or
    commodified. Gofu restores the idea that some of our most essential
    survival tools have no owner — and should never have one.
    </p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      Eating together is one form of courage.<br>
      Teaching each other how to make food from almost nothing is another.<br>
      Gofu belongs to those who need it — and to those who will carry it forward.
