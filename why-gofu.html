    <p>A little food. A bigger intention.</p>

      <h2>From our kitchen — a short origin</h2>
      <p>
        Gofu began when I wanted to make a healthier version of my mom’s beloved chicken salad. I thought of tofu — but I hesitated, aware of how much of the global tofu supply depends on soybeans.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        “What if we swap out that bean for a different one — something gentler, more flexible, more local — and turn beans + water into fresh, nourishing protein?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I started mixing other beans, water, simple tools we already had in the kitchen. Little experiments. Small meals. And eventually — Gofu was born. A humble bean-based food, but one rooted in the warmth of a family kitchen and a wish for something that felt right in body and place.

      <h2>The broader context: why another bean — not soy</h2>
      <p>
        Globally, soybean farming — especially for commodity crops, animal feed, processed foods — has significant environmental and social impacts. Evidence shows that millions of hectares of forests and native ecosystems have been cleared to make way for soy cultivation. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, between 2001 and 2015, about <strong>8.2 million hectares</strong> of land were replaced by soy cultivation — and over <strong>97%</strong> of that occurred in South America. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
        Forests, savannahs, biodiverse habitats like the Amazon rainforest, the Cerrado and other native ecosystems — are threatened when land is cleared for soy, then monocropped. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>
      <p>
        The consequences aren’t only ecological. Soil degradation, erosion, fertilizer and pesticide runoff, loss of biodiversity, and disruption of local communities have been documented in regions dominated by industrial-scale soy farming. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
        In short: a food system built on soy monocultures often carries hidden costs far beyond the soybeans in the grocery aisle.

      <h2>Gofu as a regenerative evolution of tofu-tech</h2>
      <p>
        Gofu isn’t just a taste preference or dietary choice — it’s a small act of resistance and regeneration. By re-imagining “tofu” away from its soybean roots, we open the door to practices that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>celebrate bean diversity — beans native or adapted to local soils and climates;</li>
        <li>reduce reliance on large monocultures that drive deforestation and biodiversity loss;</li>
        <li>promote food sovereignty and accessibility — by using affordable, widely available beans;</li>
        <li>invite kitchens — home, community, school — to participate in a shared food-making tradition that can be adapted, improved, and passed on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In a world increasingly in need of regenerative practices — practices that honor the needs of ecosystems and the beings who depend on them — Gofu is a gentle seed.  
        A seed for reconnecting food with place, for nourishing people without starving the land.

      <h2>Invite to adapt, share & regenerate</h2>
      <p>
        This work is offered in the spirit of generosity and collaboration.  
        <strong>Everyone</strong> is invited to try Gofu, adapt it to their beans and tastes, share their own variations — and contribute to a growing commons of recipes, stories, and sustainable food practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do try it: consider sharing what bean you used, where you live, why you made it. Over time, Gofu can grow not just as a recipe — but as a living network: of kitchens, of soils, of hope.
