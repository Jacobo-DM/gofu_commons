**Public Domain — CC0 1.0**

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried beans (chickpea, pinto, black bean, mung, lentil, etc.)
- 4 cups water
- Coagulant: lemon juice, vinegar, or nigari
- Optional: herbs, spices, citrus zest, aromatics

## Instructions

1. **Soak** the beans overnight in plenty of water.
2. **Drain** and rinse.
3. **Blend** beans with 4 cups fresh water until very smooth.
4. **Strain** through a clean cloth or fine sieve to make bean “milk.”
5. **Heat** the bean milk to a gentle simmer, stirring to prevent sticking.
6. **Add coagulant** slowly (a tablespoon at a time), stirring gently, until curds form.
7. **Rest** for a few minutes to let the curds fully separate.
8. **Pour** into a cloth-lined mold and **press** for 10–60 minutes, depending on the firmness you want.

Gofu is adaptable, resilient, and endlessly remixable.
