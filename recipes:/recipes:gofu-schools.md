## Notes for School Kitchens

- Invite students to help with safe parts of the process: soaking, blending (with supervision), pressing, seasoning.

## Discovery Mode / Classroom Ideas

- Compare different local beans and flavors.
- Map where each bean variety is grown.
- Invite students to design their own “house Gofu” recipe and name.
- Connect Gofu to conversations about food justice and sovereignty in age-appropriate ways.
