**Public Domain — CC0 1.0**

Kudzu strengthens the curd, improves texture, and adds gut-soothing benefits.

## Ingredients

- All ingredients from the base Gofu recipe
- 1–2 Tbsp kudzu starch, dissolved in a little cold water

## Instructions

1. Follow the base recipe steps to make bean “milk.”
2. After heating the bean milk, **stir in the dissolved kudzu**.
3. Cook gently, stirring, until the mixture thickens and turns glossy.
4. Proceed with **coagulant** and **pressing** as in the base recipe.

This version works especially well for:

- school kitchens
- children who need gentle, calming foods
- any context where texture and sliceability matter
