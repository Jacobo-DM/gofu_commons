  <h1>Gofu Commons</h1>

  <p>
    Gofu is a simple, nourishing bean-based food offered freely to the world.  
    It belongs to no one — and to everyone.
  </p>

  <h2>The Commons Declaration</h2>

  <p>By this declaration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>No individual, organization, company, or government may claim ownership,
        exclusivity, trademark, copyright, or patent protection over Gofu or its core processes.</li>

    <li>Communities are encouraged to adapt Gofu using local beans, flavors, and
        cultural foodways of their region.</li>

    <li>Gofu may be used in shelters, school cafeterias, mutual aid kitchens,
        home cooking, regenerative agriculture programs — anywhere nourishment
        and sovereignty are needed.</li>

    <li>Teaching Gofu is itself part of the commons: lessons, workshops,
        Discovery Mode modules, and Monster Kitchen stories may all be freely
        created and shared.</li>

    <li>No one is obligated to attribute this declaration, but all are invited
        to carry its spirit: food as a right, not a commodity; nourishment as
        relationship, not extraction.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="quote-box">
    Gofu is offered openly, joyfully, and irreversibly to the world.<br>
    May it travel far.<br>
    May it feed many.<br>
    May its simplicity strengthen the hands that need it most.
  </div>
