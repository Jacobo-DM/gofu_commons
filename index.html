      <h2>What is Gofu?</h2>
      <p>
        Gofu is a gentle, adaptable food: a tofu-like base made from beans other than soy.
        It’s designed for home kitchens, school kitchens, and community kitchens that want
        affordable nourishment without relying on a single crop.
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Core idea:</strong> a simple method that anyone can learn and pass on, so that
        more communities can turn dry beans and water into fresh, everyday protein.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>A small origin story</h2>
      <p>
        My mom loves chicken salad. I wanted to make a healthier version, so I thought of tofu
        as a substitute. Then I remembered how much estrogen is associated with soybeans, and I
        wondered:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What if we swap out that bean for a different one—something gentler and more flexible
        for everyday eating?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That question stayed with me. I started experimenting with other beans, a pot of water,
        and whatever tools we already had at home. Somewhere between those small experiments and
        my mom’s lunch, Gofu was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a simple story, but it carries the warmth that Gofu deserves: one family kitchen,
        one loved person, and a wish for food that is kinder to bodies and to the places we call home.
